			<div class="info">
				<p>India became the fourth country to make it to Mars, but the real significance was the fact India became the first country to make it on the first attempt in the lowest cost. ISRO showed world that a lot of fuel is not neaded to get to Mars. ISRO's Mars mission had the total cost of US$ 74 million while NASA's Maven project costed US$672 million. The success of this mission gained a lot of respect for ISRO on the national and international level.</p>

			<div class="info">
				<p>India broke the world record for satellites lauched. India set the new world record when ISRO sent 104 satellites into space at once. The pervious record was set by Russia when they launched 37 satellites at once. Out of the 104 satellites 101 were of international clients. This was a huge moment for ISRO and India as ISRO proved once again that it is one of the most reliable space agencies in the world.</p>

				<p>On 22 October, 2008 ISRO's Chandrayaan 1 was a success when it entered lunar orbit. Chandrayaan 1 was a huge success because it found important information about the moon. Chandrayaan one confirmed the exsistence of water on the moon. On August 20 ,2020 Chandrayaan 2 reached lunar orbit. Chandrayaan 2 is sent to take high resulation pictures of the moon and look for more details of the moon.</p>

			<div class="info">
				<p>ISRO has successfully launched it's own reasuable space shuttle called the Reusable Launch Vehicle. The first RLV was a test version and it tested several different technologies. The test flight was 770 seconds and the maximum hight it reached was 65 kilometres. The fully developed RLV will be able to take off like a rocket, put a satellite into space and return like a plane. The RLV will reduce the cost of sending a satellite to space significantly.</p>

				<p>ISRO conducted the balllon expirament. This expirament was ment to explore the atmosphere. Three new species of bacteria were discovered in the upper stratosphere. The species were named after famous people such as Fred Hoyle and the great Indian mathematician Aryabhatt.</p>

				<p>ISRO created it's own GPS system when it launched its own Navigation Satellite. This satellite would it provides real time positioning and timing services. The real satellite is knokwn as NavIC. ISRO is looking to expand its range in the future.   </p>

			<h3>Ingenious Travel Technique</h3>

			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<p>India used a clever, new technique to get to Mars. This technique helped ISRO use the least amount of fuel resulting in a very low cost. This new technique would send the satellite to Earth orbit. Then the satellite would start orbiting the Earth. Every time the satellite reached the perigee of the Earth orbit A small thrust would be given to increase the speed of the satellite and the size of the orbit. This same maneuver would continue for a few more times. Then a final thrust of fuel would be given and the speed would be too much for the Earth to hold and the satellite would make its way to its destination.</p>
